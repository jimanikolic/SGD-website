        <p>Hello! <br> <br> 
        
        My name is Jim and I am a currently enrolled 
        senior at the University of Kentucky. 
        I am a Lewis Honor's student graduating in the spring 2024 
        semester with a bachelors in Computer 
        Science and a minor in math.<br><br>
        
        I am also a pre-dental 
        student and I am pleased to say that
        after graduation I am matriculating 
        into the University of Kentucky College 
        of Dentistry class of 2028! <br><br>

        I have experience tutoring at both the college 
        and high-school level through
        volunteering at the <a href="https://carnegiecenterlex.org/"
        target="_blank">Carnegie Center for Literacy & Learning</a> 
        and tutoring my peers on campus. <br><br>

        I love tutoring because it's a chance to connect 
        with others and share the joy of learning. Being 
        part of someone's educational journey is incredibly 
        rewarding, as I get to witness students grow 
        into more confident, curious individuals. It's not 
        just about teaching; it's about building meaningful
        connections and helping people discover their own
        unique path to success. <br><br>


        <strong>I look forward to meeting you!</strong>
